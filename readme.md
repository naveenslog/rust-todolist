# Rust Todo List Application

This project is a Todo List application built with Rust, leveraging the Rocket framework for the web backend and Diesel ORM for database interactions with SQLite. It features a comprehensive system for managing todo items and extends functionality to include user management.

## Features

- **Todo List Management**: Create, read, update, and delete todo items.

- **User Management**: Register and manage users (upcoming feature).

- **API Documentation**: Swagger API documentation for easy integration (planned feature).

- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI for managing todos and users (planned feature).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)

- Diesel CLI with SQLite feature

### Clone and Start the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```sh

git  clone  https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git

cd <repository-name>

```

2.  **Set up the database:**

First, ensure you have Diesel CLI installed with SQLite support. If not, install it using the following command:

```sh

cargo  install  diesel_cli  --no-default-features  --features  sqlite

```

Then, run the Diesel migrations to set up your database:

```sh

diesel  setup

diesel  migration  run

```

3.  **Build and run the project:**

```sh

cargo  run

```

The server will start, typically listening on http://localhost:8000. Adjust the port as necessary in Rocket.toml.

## Todo Endpoints

- `GET /todos`: Retrieve a list of todos.

- `POST /todos`: Create a new todo item. Requires a JSON body with todo details.

- `PATCH /todos/{id}`: Update an existing todo item by ID. Requires a JSON body with updates.

- `DELETE /todos/{id}`: Delete a todo item by ID.

_Note: User endpoints will be available once the user management feature is implemented._

## Roadmap

- **Swagger API Documentation**: Implement Swagger for auto-generated and interactive API documentation.

- **User Management Feature**: Develop features for user registration, authentication, and association with todo items.

- **UI**: Design and implement a front-end interface for easier interaction with the todo list and user management features.
